// Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

// For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

// The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

// Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

// Example 1:
// Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
// Output: Intersected at '8'
// Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
// From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
// - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

// Example 2:
// Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
// Output: Intersected at '2'
// Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
// From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

// Example 3:
// Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
// Output: No intersection
// Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
// Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
